{"name":"Neutron-docker-plugin","tagline":"OpenStack Neutron Network Plugin for Docker","body":"# Neutron Docker network driver\r\n \r\nThis repository implements OpenStack Neutron driver for the Docker networking\r\n[remote driver](https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/remote.md).\r\n\r\nUsing the driver will result in the Docker containers joining one or more\r\nexisting or newly created Neutron networks. Each Neutron port type will have to\r\nadd support to this repository for plugging the ports it owns.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only `ovs` port is supported.\r\n\r\n## How to run it\r\n\r\nDeploy procedure:\r\n\r\n* Deploy OpenStack\r\n* Deploy neutron-openvswitch-agent on docker host if docker host and OpenStack host is not the same one\r\n* Deploy this repository via `python setup.py install` on docker host\r\n\r\nStarting neutron docker plugin:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p /usr/lib/docker/plugins\r\nneutron-docker --config-file /etc/docker/neutron_docker_plugin.conf --log-dir /var/log --debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you can create docker network with driver `neutron`:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker network create -d neutron neutronnet\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun container using neutron network:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -itd --publish-service=http1.neutronnet nginx\r\ndocker run -itd --publish-service=http2.neutronnet nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nNeutron L2 agent (such as neutron-openvswitch-agent) will be running on each\r\ndocker host. When a container is launched by the docker daemon using neutron\r\nnetwork plugin, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -itd --publish-service=http1.neutronnet nginx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen docker will request its neutron driver to provide a `neutronnet` network\r\nand `http1` endpoint. Actually, neutron driver will create a network whose name \r\nis `neutronet`'s network ID and a port whose name is `http1`'s endpoint ID. Neutron\r\ndriver will also setup essential virtual bridges and veth pairs which connects \r\ncontainer's network interface to neutron L2 agent.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
